 1. Python Basics 
Data types: (primitive)
    int 
    float 
    str 
    bool: True / False 
Variable: Identifier, which holds the data 

name = 'Mahesh'
age = 46
salary = 4000.50
is_active = True 

2. Derived Data 
single name -> many names 
single employee -> many employees 
    list 
    object of the class 
    tuple 
    dict 
    set / frozenset 
names = ['Mahesh', 'Vaishnavi', 'Banu']
employees = [Employee('Mahesh', 46, 4000.50, True), Employee('Vaishnavi', 21, 40000.75,True),
        Employee('Banu', 22, 50000, True)]

employees = [('Mahesh', 46, 4000.50, True), ('Vaishnavi', 21, 40000.75,True),
        ('Banu', 22, 50000, True)]
employees = [{'name':'Mahesh', 'age':46, 'salary':4000.50, 'is_active':True}, 
            {'name':'Vaishnavi', 'age':21, 'salary': 40000.75, 'is_active':True},
            {'name':'Banu', 'age':22, 'salary': 50000, 'is_active':True}
            
Memory Layout:
    heap 
        ref1 [Mahesh]
        ref2 [46]
        ref3 [4000.50]
        ref4 [True]
        ref5 ['Mahesh']['Vaishnavi']['Banu']        : index = 0,1,2,....
        ....
        ref6 [ref7][ref8->ref10][ref9]
        ref7 ['Mahesh'][46][4000.50][True]          : index = 0, 1,2,....
        ref8 #Vaishnavi elements 
        ref9 #Banu elements 
        ref10 ['Vaishnavi'][21][60000.75][True] 
    stack 
        name [ref1]
        age [ref2]
        salary [ref3]
        is_active [ref4]
        names [ref5]
        employees [ref6]
print(names[1], employees[1][1])

    fun_change_vaishnavi(vaishnavi):
        name, age, salary, is_active = vaishnavi #tuple 
        salary += 20000
        return (name, age, salary, is_active)
    employees[1] = fun_change_vaishnavi(employees[1])


--------

1. Python 
2. Git 
3. variables and primitive types vs derived types 

tuple, object, dictinary - to represent data like record like employee, product, flight etc 

list - to represent multiple data or records ie array of records 

app of array as the database and menu driven programming 
    - employee management 
    - tuple as employee 

Next: 
    dictionary as employee 
    object as employee 

    - persistent store : to save in file (binary file | json | csv) / database like sqlite etc
